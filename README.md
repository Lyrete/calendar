# calendar
Very simple GUI app to view a calendar, read tasks and add tasks to dates. Could be implemented using tkintercalendar etc. much easier but I wanted to keep the usage of external libraries very limited as to improve the legibility of the code to anyone.

Uses a ```.csv``` file as the database, example format available.

##### To-do

- :white_check_mark: Read/write tasks to file
- :white_square_button: Add view to show the current day's tasks
- :white_square_button: Add controls to browse months, years etc.
- :white_square_button: Add listeners so you can click on dates instead of typing
